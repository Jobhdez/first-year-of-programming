I wrote these programs back in 2019; I started learning to program in 2018 but in 2018 I focused mostly on studying "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs."

I mean I tried learning to program before 2018 but I never got anywhere.

But 2019 was my first year I made programs throughout most of the year.

A lot of the programs here were written in MIT-SCHEME and some in Python2.

Just wanted to have these here since I lost control of my first github account which you can find here: https://github.com/xsquared93.

Most of these programs were heavily influenced on the programs and style in SICP which is a great book. You should definitely read it :)

Thanks!

Happy programming :)
